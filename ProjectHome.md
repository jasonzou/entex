ENTEX recognises temporal expressions (such as "next week" or "the 4th July") and attempts to anchor them to a calendar.


Temporal expression - or timex - recognition has been attempted with both rule-based and ML-based approaches, and both work reasonably well. However, to solve the timex normalisation problem, we need explicit rules.

Many researchers have built rule-based normalisation systems and achieved high - but not complete - resolution. While independent projects have reached accuracy for around 90% of their evaluation set, the remainder is difficult to capture.

ENTEX is a modular community tool for timex extraction and normalisation. Our goal is to enable and encourage the Temporal IE community to work on these problems, through the creation and maintenance of an open-source project.

There is an ENTEX mailing list that the developers monitor. You can join it at http://groups.google.com/group/entex/ . There is also an IRC channel #entex on Freenode.
